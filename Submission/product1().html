                The String of Fishhooks is an easy-to-care-for and robust succulent. It sits beautifully on a 
                shelf because of its trailing vines. The String of Fish Hooks is very similar to the String of 
                Bananas and can sometimes be mixed up. The String of Fish Hooks is blueish green in color and the 
                leaves are much thinner and hook-like. This plant comes in its 6" hanging plastic nursery pot.
